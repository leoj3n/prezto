# @leoj3n's Prezto

Prezto is the configuration framework for [Zsh][1]; this is leoj3n's version.

## Customizations

### Home

The [home][] directory has been added because this repository is meant to be used as a [homeshick][] castle. Adding a symlink to the `zshenv` runcom has been skipped. This is because I manage that file in another, private castle and use it to set my sensitive environment variables.

  1. [git][] - added aliases and functions.
  2. [directory][] - added aliases and functions.
  3. [homebrew][] - added aliases and functions.
